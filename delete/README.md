#LiveData Migrator Delete Script

This script will remove any extra files that have been left on a remote target filesystem
that should have been deleted. The files may be left on the target due to a migration
being reset. The script consumes a verification report generated by LiveData Migrator
and deletes the the files that have been identified to be on the target but not on the 
source. The script makes requests to LiveData Migrator to delete the files.

The script can be passed the location of a verification directory or an verification
report file.

```
usage: ldm-delete.py [-h] [--debug] [-c CONFIG] [--filesystem_name FILESYSTEM_NAME]
                     [-f VERIFICATION_FILE] [-e EXCLUSION_FILE] [-d VERIFICATION_DIRECTORY]
                     [--dry-run]

Process verification report to delete extraneous content.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Configuration file.
  --filesystem_name FILESYSTEM_NAME
                        The target filesystem name. Not required if a verification directory is
                        used. The script will retrieve the target filesystem name for the migration
                        using the migration id embedded in the directory name.
  -f VERIFICATION_FILE, --verification-file VERIFICATION_FILE
                        The name of the verification report JSONL file
  -e EXCLUSION_FILE, --exclusion-file EXCLUSION_FILE
                        File of exclusion patterns for files not to be deleted, one per line.
                        Patterns are based on https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html
  -d VERIFICATION_DIRECTORY, --verification-directory VERIFICATION_DIRECTORY
                        The directory holding the verification results.
  --dry-run             List the paths that would be deleted on Target but do not delete them.
```

The configuration file delete.config holds all the configuration necessary.

The configuration file is as follows:

```
    {
      # The LiveData Migrator Endpoint
      "api_endpoint" : "http://localhost:18080",
      
      # The username and password for authenticating to LiveData Migrator
      "username" : "",
      "password" : "",

    }
```
